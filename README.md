## FAQ

### What Is BDRM?
A BRDM stands for a Bundled Runtime Datapack Mod. It is a type of Minecraft Mod that specifically loads the datapack at runtime. This helps if you are not willing to go through the effort of loading a data pack every time you create a world. Just input the mod into your mods folder and it should be enabled by default.
